# basical bootstrap modals in angular

## overview 
right now, there are two branches to look at: a basic modal example without comments, and the same basic modal with comments. i strongly recommend checking out the branch without comments first, poking around, and try to figure out the relationships on your own. once you've exhausted that, take a look at the comments.


## to run this:

- clone the repo
- `cd` into the project directory
- run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies
- run `npm start` to start the server
- navigate to http://localhost:4040 in your browser
